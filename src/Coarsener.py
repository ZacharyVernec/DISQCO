    A class that provides various coarsening methods for a quantum-circuit hypergraph.
    
    The 'hypergraph' argument is a QuantumCircuitHyperGraph-like object with:

      - .hyperedges (dict, keyed by e_id -> { 'root_set': set(...), 'receiver_set': set(...) })

      - .adjacency (dict, keyed by node -> set of neighbor_nodes)
      - .node_attrs (dict, keyed by node -> { ... attributes ... })
      - .copy() method returning a shallow copy of the hypergraph data structure.
      - .remove_hyperedge(e_id) for deleting an edge.

    The methods implemented include:
      - hyper_contract
