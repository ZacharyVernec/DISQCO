# DisQCO: Distributed Quantum Circuit Optimisation

This repository provides tools for optimising distributed quantum circuits. The primary function is a partitioning tool, which uses a temporally extended hypergraph framework to model the problem of optimally choosing teleportations between partitions. The repopsitory includes an implementation of the Fiduccia-Mattheyses partitioning heuristic which has been adapted to fit the problem constraints. For larger circuits, a multi-level partitioner is available. This uses a coarsener to produce a sequence of coarsened versions of the orignal graph, where the FM heuristic is used to partition and refine at each level. A circuit extraction tool is also included which is integrated with IBM qiskit, through which we can extract a circuit from our partitioned hypergraph which splits qubits over multiple registers and handles all cross-register communication using shared entanglement and LOCC.
